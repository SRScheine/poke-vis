# Pok√©-Vis!

Welcome to Pok√©-Vis, an application that allows users to see beautiful data visualizations of their favorite Pok√©mon!

Pok√©-Vis is a small front-end app designed as a space for developers to view, learn, and play around with data visualization using [Victory.js](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) and 3rd party API calls using the excellent [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How can I use Pok√©-Vis?

1. Interact with the visualizations I have created on the deployed website here: https://poke-vis.herokuapp.com/
2. Fork and clone this repo and try it out for yourself! Instructions for how to run this application locally can be found in the repo here: `/Running-Locally-Instructions.md`
